    <p>NOM (Number Of Methods): A high number of methods in a class can indicate a “code smell” known as “God Class”. A “God Class” is a class that has too many responsibilities and can be difficult to maintain. It can also be difficult to understand because it does too many things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>NCLOC (Non-Comment Lines Of Code): A high number of lines of code can indicate a “code smell” known as “Long Method” or “Large Class”. These “smells” occur when methods or classes are too long, which can make the code difficult to understand and maintain.</p>
    <br>    
    <p>CYCLO (Cyclomatic Complexity): High cyclomatic complexity means there are many execution paths through the code, which can indicate a “code smell” called “Complex Class”. These classes are difficult to test and maintain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>AWM (Average Weighted Method): This metric measures the average complexity of a class’s methods. A high value can indicate a “code smell” called “Complex Method”, where the methods are too complex.</p>
    <br>
    <p>NOC (Number Of Classes): A high number of classes in a project can indicate a “code smell” known as “Overloaded Project”. An “Overloaded Project” is a project that has too many classes and can be difficult to maintain. It can also be difficult to understand because it does too many things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>NOCL (Number Of Comment Lines): A high number of comment lines can indicate a “code smell” known as “Excessive Comments”. These “smells” occur when there are too many comments, which can make the code difficult to understand and maintain.</p>
    <br>    
    <p>NOF (Number Of Files): A high number of files in a project can indicate a “code smell” known as “Cluttered Project”. A “Cluttered Project” is a project that has too many files and can be difficult to maintain. It can also be difficult to understand because it does too many things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>NOS (Number Of Statements): A high number of statements in a project can indicate a “code smell” known as “Overloaded Method”. An “Overloaded Method” is a method that has too many statements and can be difficult to maintain. It can also be difficult to understand because it does too many things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>WMC (Weighted Method Count): A high weighted method count indicates a complex class with potentially too many methods. It can make the class difficult to understand and maintain, impacting the overall project's maintainability.</p>
